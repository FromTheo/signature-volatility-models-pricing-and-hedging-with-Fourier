### Signature volatility models: pricing and hedging with Fourier 

This repository reproduces the results of  [Abi Jaber and Gérard (2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01820). 

We implement:
- exact characteristic function representations (OU, mGBM, CIR and path-dependent processes such as RL fBM),
- Fourier-based pricing of European, Asian options and $q$-volatility swaps,
- calibration on synthetic models (Quintic Ornstein–Uhlenbeck diffusion) and market data (SPX),
- quadratic hedging by Fourier methods. 

### Examples of illustrations
